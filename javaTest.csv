*	Question	Answer
	Why is Java a platform independent language?	Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or software due to the fact that the compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which can be run on multiple systems.
	Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?	Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object oriented language.
	Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this.	Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program. And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java program when it is required, mostly during the runtime of the program.
	Can java be said to be the complete object-oriented programming language?	It is not wrong if we claim that java is the complete object-oriented programming language. Because Everything in Java is under the classes. And we can access that by creating the objects.
	How is Java different from C++?	C++ is only a  compiled language, whereas Java is compiled as well as an interpreted language.
	Pointers are used in C/ C++. Why does Java not make use of pointers?	Pointers are quite complicated and unsafe to use by beginner programmers. Java focuses on code simplicity, and the usage of pointers can make it challenging. Pointer utilization can also cause potential errors. Moreover, security is also compromised if pointers are used because the users can directly access memory with the help of pointers.
	What do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable?	Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.
	What are the default values assigned to variables and instances in java?	There are no default values assigned to the variables in java. We need to initialize the value before using it. Otherwise, it will throw a compilation error of (Variable might not be initialized). 
	What do you mean by data encapsulation?	Data Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept of hiding the data attributes and their behaviours in a single unit.
	Tell us something about JIT compiler.	JIT stands for Just-In-Time and it is used for improving the performance during run time. It does the task of compiling parts of byte code having similar functionality at the same time thereby reducing the amount of compilation time for the code to run.
	What is a ClassLoader?	A classloader in Java is a subsystem of Java Virtual Machine, dedicated to loading class files when a program is executed; ClassLoader is the first to load the executable file.
	What are the Memory Allocations available in JavaJava?	Java has five significant types of memory allocations. Class Memory, Heap Memory, Stack Memory, Program Counter-Memory, Native Method Stack Memory
	What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?	Stack is generally used to store the order of method execution and local variables. In contrast, Heap memory is used to store the objects. After storing, they use dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
	Will the program run if we write static public void main?	Yes, the program will successfully execute if written so. Because, in Java, there is no specific rule for the order of specifiers
	What is the default value stored in Local Variables?	Neither the Local Variables nor any primitives and Object references have any default value stored in them.
	"System.out.println(100 + 100 +“Simplilearn"");   "	200Simplilearn
	"System.out.println(“E-Learning Company"" + 100 + 100);  "	E-Learning Company100100
	What is an Association?	An Association can be defined as a relationship that has no ownership over another. For example, a person can be associated with multiple banks, and a bank can be related to various people, but no one can own the other.
	What do you mean by aggregation?	The term aggregation refers to the relationship between two classes best described as a “whole/part” and “has-a” relationship. This kind is the most specialized version of an association relationship. It contains the reference to another class and is said to have ownership of that class.
	Define Copy Constructor in Java	A Copy Constructor in Java is a constructor that initializes an object through another object of the same class.
	What is a Marker Interface?	An empty interface in Java is referred to as a Marker interface. Serializable and Cloneable are some famous examples of Marker Interface. 
	What is Object Cloning?	An ability to recreate an object entirely similar to an existing object is known as Object Cloning in Java. Java provides a clone() method to clone a current object offering the same functionality as the original object.
	Why is Java not completely object-oriented?	Java is not considered as a 100% object-oriented programming language because it still makes use of eight or more primitive data types like int, float double, etc.
	What is an object-oriented paradigm?	A Paradigm that is based on the concepts of “Objects.” It contains data and code. Data that is in the form of fields, and regulation, that is in the form of procedures. The exciting feature of this paradigm is that the object’s procedures can access and often modify the data fields themselves.
	Define Wrapper Classes in Java.	In Java, when you declare primitive datatypes, then Wrapper classes are responsible for converting them into objects(Reference types). 
	Define Singleton Classes in Java.	In Java, when you make the constructor of a class private, that particular class can generate only one object. This type of class is popularly known as a Singleton Class.
	Define package in Java.	The package is a collective bundle of classes and interfaces and the necessary libraries and JAR files. The use of packages helps in code reusability.
	Can you implement pointers in a Java Program?	Java Virtual Machine takes care of memory management implicitly. Java's primary motto was to keep programming simple. So, accessing memory directly through pointers is not a recommended action. Hence, pointers are eliminated in Java. 
	Differentiate between instance and local variables.	For instance, variables are declared inside a class, and the scope is limited to only a specific object. A local variable can be anywhere inside a method or a specific block of code. Also, the scope is limited to the code segment where the variable is declared.
	Explain Java String Pool.	A collection of strings in Java's Heap memory is referred to as Java String Pool. In case you try to create a new string object, JVM first checks for the presence of the object in the pool. If available, the same object reference is shared with the variable, else a new object is created.
	What is an Exception?	An Exception in Java is considered an unexpected event that can disrupt the program's normal flow. These events can be fixed through the process of Exception Handling.
	What is the final keyword in Java?	The term final is a predefined word in Java that is used while declaring values to variables. When a value is declared using the final keyword, then the variable's value remains constant throughout the program's execution.
	What happens when the main() isn't declared as static?	"When the main method is not declared as static, then the program may be compiled correctly but ends up with a severe ambiguity and throws a run time error that reads ""NoSuchMethodError."""
	What is JDK? Mention the variants of JDK?	JDK is an abbreviation for Java Development Kit. It is a combined Package of JRE and Developer tools used for designing Java Applications and Applets. Oracle has the following variants.
	What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?	JVM has a Just in Time (JIT) compiler tool that converts all the Java source code into the low-level compatible machine language. Therefore, it runs faster than the regular application. JRE has class libraries and other JVM supporting files. But it doesn’t have any tool for java development such as compiler or debugger. JDK has tools that are required to write Java Programs and uses JRE to execute them. It has a compiler, Java application launcher, and an applet viewer.
	What is a JIT compiler?	JIT compiler refers to Just in Time compiler. It is the simplest way of executing the computer code that takes in compilation during the execution of a program rather than before performance. It commonly uses bytecode translation to machine code. It is then executed directly.
	What are Brief Access Specifiers and Types of Access Specifiers?	Access Specifiers are predefined keywords used to help JVM understand the scope of a variable, method, and class. We have four access specifiers. Public Access Specifier, Private Access Specifier, Protected Access Specifier, Default Access Specifier
	How many types of constructors are used in Java?	There are two types of constructors that are used in Java.    Parameterized Constructors: Parameterized constructor accepts the parameters with which users can initialize the instance variables. Users can initialize the class variables dynamically at the time of instantiating the class.    Default constructors: This type doesn’t accept any parameters; rather, it instantiates the class variables with their default values. It is used mainly for object creation.
	Can a constructor return a value?	Yes, A constructor can return a value. It replaces the class's current instance implicitly; you cannot make a constructor return a value explicitly.
	Explain ‘this’ keyword in Java.	"The term ""this"" is a particular keyword designated as a reference keyword. The ""this"" keyword is used to refer to the current class properties like method, instance, variable, and constructors."
	Explain ‘super’ keyword in Java.	"The term ""super"" is a particular keyword designated as a reference keyword. The ""super"" keyword refers to the immediate parent class object."
	Explain Method Overloading in Java.	The process of creating multiple method signatures using one method name is called Method Overloading in Java. 
	Can we overload a static method?	"No, Java does not support the Overloading of a static method. The process would throw an error reading ""static method cannot be referenced."""
	Define Late Binding.	Binding is a process of unifying the method call with the method's code segment. Late binding happens when the method's code segment is unknown until it is called during the runtime. 
	Define Dynamic Method Dispatch.	The Dynamic method dispatch is a process where the method call is executed during the runtime. A reference variable is used to call the super-class. This process is also known as Run-Time Polymorphism. 
	Why is the delete function faster in the linked list than an array?	Delete Function is faster in linked lists as the user needs to make a minor update to the pointer value so that the node can point to the next successor in the list
	Give a briefing on the life cycle of a thread.	The life cycle of a thread includes five stages: New Born State, Runnable State, Running State, Blocked State, Dead State
	Explain the difference between >> and >>> operators.	>> operator does the job of right shifting the sign bits >>> operator is used in shifting out the zero-filled bits
	Brief the life cycle of an applet.	Initialization, Start, Stop, Destroy, Paint
	Why are generics used in Java Programming?	Compile-time type safety is provided by using generics. Compile-time type safety allows users to catch unnecessary invalid types at compile time. Generic methods and classes help programmers specify a single method declaration, a set of related methods, or related types with an available class declaration. 
	Explain the Externalizable interface.	"The Externalizable interface helps with control over the process of serialization. An ""externalisable"" interface incorporates readExternal and writeExternal methods."
	What is the Daemon Thread?	The Daemon thread can be defined as a thread with the least priority. This Daemon thread is designed to run in the background during the Garbage Collection in Java. The setDaemon() method creates a Daemon thread in Java.
	 Explain the term enumeration in Java.	Enumeration or enum is an interface in Java. Enum allows the sequential access of the elements stored in a collection in Java.
	Why is Java is Dynamic?	Java is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs include a large amount of runtime information that is used to resolve access to objects in real-time. 
	Can you run a code before executing the main method?	Yes, we can execute any code, even before the main method. We will be using a static block of code when creating the objects at the class's load time. Any statements within this static block of code will get executed at once while loading the class, even before creating objects in the main method.
	How many times is the finalize method called?	The finalize method is called the Garbage collector. For every object, the Garbage Collector calls the finalize() method just for one time.
	"Can ""this"" and ""super"" keywords be used together?"	"No, ""this"" and ""super"" keywords should be used in the first statement in the class constructor."
	What is a JSP page?	JSP is an abbreviation for Java Servlet Page. 
	What is JDBC?	JDBC is an abbreviation for Java Database Connector. JDBC is an abstraction layer used to establish connectivity between an existing database and a Java application
	Explain the various directives in JSP.	"Directives are instructions processed by JSP Engine. After the JSP page is compiled into a Servlet, Directives set page-level instructions, insert external files, and define customized tag libraries. Directives are defined using the symbols below: start with ""< %@"" and then end with ""% >"" "
	What are the observer and observable classes?	"Objects that inherit the ""Observable class"" take care of a list of ""observers.""  When an Observable object gets upgraded, it calls the update() method of each of its observers.  After that, it notifies all the observers that there is a change of state. The Observer interface gets implemented by objects that observe Observable objects."
	What is Session Management in Java?	A session is essentially defined as the random conversation's dynamic state between the client and the server. The virtual communication channel includes a string of responses and requests from both sides. The popular way of implementing session management is establishing a session ID in the client's communicative discourse and the server.
	Briefly explain the term Spring Framework.	Spring is essentially defined as an application framework and inversion of control containers for Java. The spring framework creates enterprise applications in Java. Especially useful to keep in mind that the spring framework's central features are essentially conducive to any Java application.
	How to handle exceptions in Spring MVC Framework?	Spring MVC has two approaches for handling the exceptions: Exception handler method: In this kind of exception handling, the user will get the @ExceptionHandler annotation type used to annotate a method to handle exceptions.XML Configuration: The user can use the SimpleMappingExceptionResolver bean in Spring’s application file and map the exception.
	What is JCA in Java?	Java Cryptography Architecture gives a platform and provides architecture and application programming interfaces that enable decryption and encryption. 
	Explain JPA in Java.	The Java Persistence API enables us to create the persistence layer for desktop and web applications. 
	Explain the different authentications in Java Servlets.	Authentication options are available in Servlets: There are four different options for authentication in servlet: Basic Authentication: Usernames and passwords are given by the client to authenticate the user. Form-based authentication: In this, the login form is made by the programmer by using HTML. Digest Authentication: It is similar to basic authentication, but the passwords are encrypted using the Hash formula. Hash Formula makes digest more secure. Client certificate Authentication: It requires that each client accessing the resource has a certificate that it sends to authenticate itself. Client Authentication requires the SSL protocol.
	Explain FailFast iterator and FailSafe iterator along with examples for each.	FailFast iterators and FailSafe iterators are used in Java Collections. FailFast iterators do not allow changes or modifications to the Java Collections, which means they fail when the latest element is added to the collection or an existing element gets removed from the collection. The FailFast iterators tend to fail and throw an exception called ConcurrentModificationException. Ex: ArrayList, HashMap Whereas, on the other hand, FailSafe iterators allow changes or modifications to be done on the Java Collections. It is possible, as the FailSafe iterators usually operate on the cloned copy of the collection. Hence, they do not throw any specific exception. Ex: CopyOnWriteArrayList
	How do we reverse a string?	
	Write a program to find the square root of a number.	
	Write a program that detects the duplicate characters in a string.	
	Write a Program to remove duplicates in an ArrayList.	
	Find the word count in a string using HashMap Collection.	
	Write a program to find the Second Highest number in an ArrayList	
	What is the difference between System.out, System.err, and System.in?	System.out and System.err represent the monitor by default and thus can be used to send data or results to the monitor. System.out is used to display normal messages and results. System.eerr is used to display error messages. System.in represents InputStream object which by default represents standard input device, i.e., keyboard.
	Could you provide some implementation of a Dictionary having a large number of words?	The simplest implementation that can be given is that of a List wherein one can place ordered words and perform a Binary search. The other implementation with a better search performance is HashMap where the key is used as the first character of the word and the value as a LinkedList.
	How would you tackle it if you might have to encounter pattern programs in Java?
